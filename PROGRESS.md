## Decisions log

- **2026-07-08 — Alfajores is sunset.** Its Forno endpoint is NXDOMAIN
  (sunset after Celo's L2 migration). Testnet is **Celo Sepolia**: chain id
  11142220, RPC `https://forno.celo-sepolia.celo-testnet.org`, explorer
  `https://celo-sepolia.blockscout.com`. Config rejects `alfajores` with a
  helpful error. Sepolia test funds will be needed for Phase 4.
- **2026-07-08 — Own paid data proxy for x402 (Track 2).** No macro/XAUUSD
  provider supports x402 natively, so Phase 2 builds a thin internal service
  that fetches from free/cheap upstreams and re-exposes gold spot, macro
  calendar, and news headlines behind HTTP 402 via Celo's facilitator
  (x402.celo.org). Full pricing control; every data pull = one x402 payment.
  The `MarketDataProvider` interface (one method per data type) is the
  proxy's API contract: `getGoldPrice()`, `getMacroCalendar()`,
  `getNewsSentiment()` → one paid endpoint each.

- **2026-07-09 — Finnhub dropped for the macro calendar.** Its
  `/calendar/economic` endpoint is premium-only: 403 "You don't have access
  to this resource" on the free key (the key itself works — `/quote` returns
  200). Trading Economics' guest API is discontinued (HTTP 410). Replaced
  with two keyless feeds in `packages/market-data/src/calendar.ts`:
  **TradingView** (`economic-calendar.tradingview.com/events`, needs an
  `Origin: https://www.tradingview.com` header) as primary — has actuals,
  forecasts, numeric importance, currency; **Forex Factory** weekly JSON
  (`nfs.faireconomy.media/ff_calendar_thisweek.json`) as fallback — no
  actuals, so surprise scoring degrades to event-risk damping only. Both are
  unofficial feeds; if TradingView ever blocks, the fallback kicks in
  automatically. `FINNHUB_API_KEY` is now unused (removed from
  `.env.example`; harmless leftover in `.env`).

- **2026-07-09 — Mento over Ubeswap for Phase 3 swaps.** Mento is the only
  DEX actually deployed on Celo Sepolia (Ubeswap is mainnet-only). Probed
  live: BiPoolManager has 16 exchanges including **USDm ↔ native Circle
  USDC** (`0xacc98838…bcffd7`) — the exact USDC the wallet holds — with sane
  ~1:1 quotes. One Broker contract does quote (`getAmountOut`) + swap
  (`swapIn`). Sepolia addresses (docs.mento.org, Blockscout-verified
  proxies): Broker `0xB9Ae2065142EB79b6c5EB1E8778F883fad6B07Ba`,
  BiPoolManager `0xeCB3C656C131fCd9bB8D1d80898716bD684feb78`, USDm
  `0xdE9e4C3ce781b4bA68120d6261cbad65ce0aB00b`.
- **2026-07-09 — Signal→trade mapping (documented simplification).** XAUUSD
  direction is expressed on the USDC/USDm stablecoin pair: LONG buys USDm,
  SHORT sells it back, size = confidence × MAX_POSITION_USD. The deliverable
  is signal-gated, risk-controlled, ERC-8021-attributed volume (Track 1),
  not synthetic gold exposure.
- **2026-07-09 — X402_PAY_TO moved to a separate user wallet**
  (`0x9864a892c37e240b1398d3c93d5bA8A530F118d2`) — no more self-payment
  loop. Verified: settled Transfer decoded on-chain, 0.005 USDC
  agent → new payTo. `.env.example` now warns to use a separate address.

## Phase 1 summary (signal engine)

- `packages/signal-engine`: `MarketDataProvider` interface + payload types
  (`GoldPriceData` w/ hourly candles, `MacroEvent`, `NewsSentimentData`).
- `MockMarketDataProvider`: seedable (mulberry32) offline provider —
  reproducible data per seed; used until the Phase 2 proxy exists.
- `generateSignal(provider, config?)` combines three scored components in
  [-1, 1]: price action (SMA5/SMA20 divergence, damped at RSI(14) extremes),
  macro surprise (USD releases vs forecast, hot USD ⇒ bearish gold —
  documented simplification), news sentiment. Weighted 0.5/0.3/0.2 →
  composite; confidence < 0.25 ⇒ flat. High-impact USD event within 2h damps
  confidence ×0.3 (don't trade into FOMC/CPI). All knobs in `SignalConfig`.
- Tests: `npm test` (node:test via tsx) — indicators, direction cases, event
  damping, macro surprise sign, seed reproducibility.
- `apps/agent` now runs the real engine on mock data and prints the
  component breakdown.

## Pre-existing setup (do not redo)

- Wallet funded (CELO gas + USDT) on Celo Mainnet.
- Agent registered on-chain via ERC-8004 (8004scan.io); registration tweet up.
- Celo Builders submission skill installed.

## Phase 2 summary (x402 paid data proxy)

Facilitator facts (probed live 2026-07-08):
- API hosts: `api.x402.celo.org` (mainnet) / `api.x402.sepolia.celo.org`
  (Sepolia). Standard x402 v1 interface; networks `celo` / `celo-sepolia`.
- `/verify` is open; `/settle` requires `X-API-Key` + prepaid credits
  ($0.001/settlement, topped up in USDC). API key is created at
  x402.celo.org by connecting a wallet and signing a message (browser,
  one-time — no private key in this repo).
- Supported assets: mainnet USDC + USDT, Sepolia USDC only. USDC EIP-712
  domain `{name:"USDC",version:"2"}` verified on-chain both networks; USDT
  is `{name:"Tether USD"}` with no version() — default asset is USDC.
- **The official x402 npm packages (v1.2.0) do NOT support Celo networks**
  — protocol is hand-rolled in `packages/x402-payments` (x402 v1 "exact"
  scheme, EIP-3009 transferWithAuthorization via viem).

Wallet-sides answer: the SELLER needs no private key (public `X402_PAY_TO`
address + facilitator API key). The BUYER (agent) signs each payment with
`PRIVATE_KEY` — that is a gasless stablecoin spend, so real paid pulls only
happen once the user sets the key + funds USDC.

Built:
- `packages/market-data`: Twelve Data (XAU/USD 1h), Finnhub (economic
  calendar — replaced 2026-07-09 with keyless TradingView/Forex Factory, see
  decisions log), NewsAPI + local AFINN sentiment with gold-domain term
  corrections; `DirectMarketDataProvider` with per-source mock fallback.
- `packages/x402-payments`: protocol types/codecs, `FacilitatorClient`,
  `X402Client` (buyer), `gateRequest` (seller), `X402MarketDataProvider`
  (accumulates receipts for Track 2 counting).
- `apps/data-proxy`: `/gold` `/calendar` `/news` behind the x402 gate;
  modes free / verify-only / settle depending on env. `npm run proxy`.
- Agent picks provider: proxy+key → x402-paid; else direct upstreams; else
  mock. Prints payment receipts + settled tx hashes.
- Verified live with zero funds: `scripts/x402-smoke.ts` — throwaway key's
  payment passed facilitator schema+signature checks, rejected only
  `insufficient_funds`. 15/15 tests pass.

## 2026-07-09 — first real run debugged; x402 settlement LIVE on Sepolia

User's first proxy+agent run hit two issues; both diagnosed and fixed:

1. **Finnhub 403 on the macro calendar** — premium-only endpoint; replaced
   with keyless TradingView/Forex Factory feeds (see decisions log).
2. **Proxy in "free" mode, agent bypassing it (zero x402 payments).**
   Root cause: `.env` was created from an older template that predates the
   x402 section — `X402_PAY_TO` and `DATA_PROXY_URL` were entirely absent
   (only `X402_FACILITATOR_API_KEY` had been added), so the proxy saw no
   pay-to (→ free mode) and the agent saw no proxy URL (→ direct upstreams).
   Two more latent blockers found on the way:
   - `PRIVATE_KEY` lacked the `0x` prefix — `requirePrivateKey()` would have
     thrown the moment the proxy path activated. Prefixed in place.
   - A stale proxy process from the earlier (free-mode) run still held port
     4021; it had to be killed or the fixed proxy exits with EADDRINUSE and
     the old free-mode one keeps answering.

   Fixes applied to `.env`: `PRIVATE_KEY` 0x-prefixed;
   `X402_PAY_TO=0xd16f066D8789C4D5d29e61ec63bD26d01A6c7D7E` (the agent's own
   wallet — buyer pays seller = self-transfer, net cost ≈ facilitator fees;
   change if revenue should land elsewhere); `DATA_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:4021`;
   `X402_PRICE_USD=0.005`.

Verified live (2026-07-09):
- Facilitator key accepted by the **Sepolia** host (`/settle` with the key →
  schema error not 401; bogus key → 401), so keys from x402.celo.org work on
  both networks.
- Wallet `0xd16f...7D7E` on Sepolia: 0.3 CELO, 20 USDC.
- Proxy `/info` → `paymentMode: "settle"`; unpaid `/gold` → proper 402.
- Full agent cycle: **3/3 payments settled on-chain** (USDC
  `transferWithAuthorization`, receipt status 0x1, e.g. tx
  `0xc829191c...db68a18` block 30332074). Track 2 counting works.
- 15/15 tests still pass.

Routine run: `npm run proxy` in one terminal, `npm run agent` in another —
each agent cycle = 3 settled x402 payments. If the proxy logs a port error,
check for a stale listener: `lsof -nP -iTCP:4021 -sTCP:LISTEN`.

## Phase 3 summary (swap execution + attribution + risk controls)

Built 2026-07-09 in `packages/swap-engine` (23/23 tests pass, 8 new):

- `mento.ts` — Mento v2 Broker adapter (viem): `findExchangeId` via
  BiPoolManager, `getQuote`, `buildSwapCalldata` = `swapIn` calldata with the
  ERC-8021 attribution suffix concat'd on (Solidity ignores trailing
  calldata; indexers recover it with `fromDataSuffix`).
- Attribution: `@celo/attribution-tags@0.3.0`, code **`bianca_markets`**
  (env `ATTRIBUTION_CODE`; codes must match `/^[a-z0-9_]{1,32}$/`, no
  registration needed). Round-trip covered by tests.
- `risk.ts` — `RiskManager`, enforced BEFORE any swap and logged even in dry
  run: per-trade cap `MAX_POSITION_USD` (default $5, oversized trades are
  clamped) + daily realized-loss limit `DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD` (default $10,
  halts trading until UTC midnight). Ledger in `.state/risk-<network>.json`
  (gitignored); only REAL fills are recorded, loss = amountInUsd −
  amountOutUsd on stable/stable.
- `executeSwap` — quote → slippage floor (`SWAP_SLIPPAGE_BPS`, default 50)
  → dry-run report OR balance/allowance check, approve if needed, tagged
  `swapIn`, receipt check, amountOut decoded from the tokenOut Transfer log.
  **Hard gates:** `dryRun` must be explicitly false; mainnet swaps throw
  until the Phase 4/5 verification pass regardless of dryRun=false.
- Agent: signal → `tradeFromSignal` (flat ⇒ no trade) → risk decision
  (always printed) → dry-run prints the exact would-be swap with a live
  on-chain quote. Verified full cycle on Sepolia 2026-07-09: 3 settled x402
  payments, then `DRY RUN — would buy $3.01: 3.01 USDC → 3.0087 USDm
  (floor 2.9937)` via the USDm/USDC exchange, attribution bianca_markets.

## First real Sepolia swap — executed + verified 2026-07-09

User-approved in chat (per the transaction-by-transaction rule; DRY_RUN=false
was set on the command line only — `.env` keeps DRY_RUN=true):

- Cycle: 3 settled x402 payments → XAUUSD LONG 0.601 → risk pass →
  **EXECUTED buy 3.01 USDC → 3.0087 USDm**, tx
  `0x9e31a3314a5f2692ed932ed4a6f107028ec4b1a5670068ab2c37cab612b2c4ee`
  (block 30334075, to = Mento Broker, status success).
- Attribution verified via the indexer path (`verifyTx`):
  `{"codes":["bianca_markets"],"schemaId":0}` — Track 1 counting works.
- Transfers decoded: 3.01 USDC trader → Mento Reserve; 3.0087 USDm → agent.
- Risk ledger recorded the $0.0013 spread as realized loss ($10 daily limit).
- Wallet now holds USDm, so the SHORT path is testable next.

## Phase 4 summary (Sepolia validation) — all four checks PASS 2026-07-09

Tooling: `scripts/phase4-validate.ts` (steps: clamp | short | halt | reset |
all; dry by default, `short --real` sends the one approved sell).

1. **SHORT path** — real user-approved sell: 3 USDm → 3.000093 USDC, tx
   `0x282118c1…d51b9e` (block 30335133), attribution decoded
   `{"codes":["bianca_markets"],"schemaId":0}`, fill recorded (tiny profit ⇒
   no loss added).
2. **Ledger accumulates across separate processes** — 4 fills in
   `.state/risk-sepolia.json` from 4 different runs (Phase 3 buy, Phase 4
   sell, 2 real agent cycles); cycle 1 started from the prior $0.0013 and
   ended $0.0026, cycle 2 started $0.0026 → $0.0040. Buy txs
   `0x57a62831…783e76`, `0x4f90e67e…b41cc0` — both attribution-verified.
3. **Daily-limit halt** — with the real ledger and a tiny
   `DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD`, `evaluate()` blocks AND the full agent prints
   `BLOCKED by risk controls — no trade`; a yesterday-dated ledger is
   ignored (fresh $0 after UTC midnight; also unit-tested with an injected
   clock).
4. **Clamp is real** — $50 request → $5 decision and the dry-run quote is
   built from the clamped 5 USDC, not the requested amount.

## Mainnet diff (Phase 5 readiness — review together BEFORE flipping)

What changes Sepolia → mainnet when `CELO_NETWORK=mainnet`:

- **Chain/RPC**: chain id 11142220 → 42220, RPC forno.celo-sepolia →
  `https://forno.celo.org` (both already in `packages/config/src/chains.ts`).
- **x402**: facilitator host `api.x402.sepolia.celo.org` →
  `api.x402.celo.org`, network name `celo-sepolia` → `celo`; the SAME
  facilitator API key works on both hosts (verified 2026-07-09).
  Settlement asset becomes mainnet USDC
  `0xcebA9300f2b948710d2653dD7B07f33A8B32118C`; buyer wallet needs mainnet
  USDC (currently holds CELO + USDT — swap or bridge some to USDC),
  facilitator credits stay topped in USDC.
- **Swap pair**: USDm → **cUSD** `0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a`
  (agent already maps this per network). Mainnet BiPoolManager
  (`0x22d9db95E6Ae61c104A7B6F6C78D7993B94ec901`) has 16 exchanges and the
  cUSD/USDC exchange EXISTS — probed live 2026-07-09, exchangeId
  `0xacc98838…bcffd7`. Broker `0x777A8255cA72412f0d706dc03C9D1987306B4CaD`.
- **Code gate to remove deliberately**: `executeSwap` currently THROWS on
  any real mainnet swap. Flipping mainnet on = (a) celoscan.io verification
  of Broker/BiPoolManager/cUSD/USDC addresses (Phase 4 gate rule), then
  (b) removing/flag-gating that throw in `packages/swap-engine/src/index.ts`
  — an explicit code change reviewed in chat, never an env flip.
- **Unchanged**: DRY_RUN=true default, per-tx approval rule, risk limits
  (fresh ledger file `.state/risk-mainnet.json`), attribution code
  `bianca_markets`, X402_PAY_TO (user's separate wallet).

## Mainnet address verification — PASSED 2026-07-09 (read-only)

Per the Phase 4 gate rule, all three mainnet addresses verified through
three independent lanes (Celoscan + on-chain cross-consistency + official
docs). No code or config touched; the mainnet gate in `executeSwap` stays.

1. **Broker `0x777A8255cA72412f0d706dc03C9D1987306B4CaD`** ✅
   - Celoscan: verified source, contract `BrokerProxy`, public name tag
     **"Mento Labs: Broker"**.
   - History: deployed 2023-03-07 (Mento v2 era), ~2.25M transactions — an
     established contract, not a fresh lookalike. Owner is a verified
     governance `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`, not an EOA.
   - On-chain: `getExchangeProviders()` returns exactly the documented
     BiPoolManager `0x22d9db95…ec901`; same Broker interface we exercised on
     Sepolia (and the cUSD/USDC exchangeId is identical to Sepolia's
     `0xacc98838…bcffd7`).
   - docs.mento.org lists this address as Broker (v2), Celo Mainnet.
2. **cUSD `0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a`** ✅
   - Celoscan: verified `StableTokenProxy`, public name tag **"Celo: cUSD
     Token"**, token tracker "Mento Dollar (USDm)".
   - History: deployed 2020-04-22 (Celo genesis era), ~285M transactions —
     THE canonical StableToken, impossible to fake.
   - On-chain: referenced verbatim as an asset of the BiPoolManager's
     cUSD/USDC exchange; 18 decimals, ~14.2M supply.
   - **Note:** on-chain identity is now `name="Mento Dollar"`,
     `symbol="USDm"` — Mento rebranded cUSD to USDm on mainnet (matches the
     Sepolia token). Same canonical contract; our config's `cUSD` label is
     cosmetic and can be renamed during Phase 5 execution.
3. **USDC `0xcebA9300f2b948710d2653dD7B07f33A8B32118C`** ✅
   - Celoscan: verified `FiatTokenProxy`, public name tag **"Circle: USDC
     Token"**.
   - Circle's official developer docs list exactly this address as native
     USDC on Celo mainnet.
   - History: deployed 2024-01-08 (Circle's native-USDC-on-Celo launch),
     ~489k transactions; 6 decimals.
   - On-chain: referenced verbatim in the same Mento cUSD/USDC exchange the
     agent would trade.

Remaining for Phase 5 execution (next session, in order): fund mainnet
USDC for x402 buys, remove the mainnet gate in
`packages/swap-engine/src/index.ts` as a reviewed code change, first
mainnet swap with explicit per-tx approval, 8004scan activation, Celo
Builders submission.

## 2026-07-10 — mainnet live: gate removed, x402 settled, seed swap executed

1. **Funding corrected.** The "pre-existing mainnet CELO+USDT" from the
   setup notes was NOT on the agent wallet — `0xd16f…7D7E` had zero balance
   and zero history on mainnet (both lanes: Forno `eth_call` + Blockscout).
   User funded it fresh: 42.46 CELO + ~5 USDC (less than the recommended 20
   — a full-size $5 trade is tight; top-up suggested). Facilitator credits
   confirmed on the mainnet host by the user.
2. **Mainnet gate removed** (user-reviewed diff, approved in chat): the
   Phase 3 `throw` on `!dryRun && network === 'mainnet'` deleted from
   `executeSwap`; stale "mainnet is GATED" comment in `mento.ts` updated.
   Remaining guards: DRY_RUN=true default, explicit `dryRun:false`
   required, risk clamp/halt, per-tx approval rule. 23/23 tests pass.
3. **First mainnet agent cycle (dry-run swap): 3/3 x402 payments settled
   on-chain** — the agent's first real mainnet txs (gold
   `0x5fb7949f…87ca05`, news `0xff48aaab…4ae16a`, calendar
   `0x627fe5eb…fc7e144`). Signal came out SHORT 0.266 →
   sell $1.33 USDm, **unexecutable: wallet held zero USDm** (dry run
   doesn't balance-check; the SHORT path needs inventory from a prior
   LONG — on Sepolia the first signal happened to be LONG).
4. **SEED SWAP (manual, NOT signal-driven) — first real mainnet swap.**
   User chose seeding over waiting for a LONG; $1.5 approved per-tx.
   `scripts/seed-swap.ts` (new; dry-run default, `--real` flag):
   **1.5 USDC → 1.499220530913 USDm**, tx
   `0x96b8d4f90996eee9d3c70d8d2f0f529e1acb2241ff0d15c48ed5c1a66bf2c776`
   (block 71798356, to = mainnet Broker, status success). Attribution
   decoded `{"codes":["bianca_markets"],"schemaId":0}` via new
   `scripts/verify-swap.ts`. Ledger `.state/risk-mainnet.json` fill carries
   `note: "manual seed (inventory for SHORT path), not signal-driven"` —
   risk.ts `Fill` gained an optional `note` field for exactly this.
   **Do not count this seed as organic signal-driven volume** in any
   Track 1 reporting; organic mainnet volume starts with the NEXT swap.
   Post-swap wallet: ~3.48 USDC + ~1.499 USDm + gas CELO.

Remaining for Phase 5: first ORGANIC (signal-driven) mainnet swap with
per-tx approval — both LONG and SHORT now executable; 8004scan activation;
Celo Builders submission.

## 2026-07-10 — 8004scan ACTIVATED (active + x402 support on-chain)

The agent is **Bianca Markets #9660** on the ERC-8004 Identity Registry
`0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432` (Celo mainnet, verified
`IdentityRegistryUpgradeable` behind an ERC1967 proxy). Key findings:

- The "Agent is Active" / "x402 Payment Support" fields are NOT site
  toggles — 8004scan renders the registration JSON from `tokenURI(9660)`,
  which for this agent is a fully on-chain base64 `data:` URI. Updating it
  = `setAgentURI(uint256,string)` (selector `0x0af28bd3`) signed by the
  OWNER wallet `0x9bfb…09e9` (a third wallet — not the trading wallet, not
  the payTo wallet; it was empty and needed a CELO dust top-up first).
- Spec vs wizard casing: EIP-8004 says `x402Support`/`supportedTrust`;
  8004scan's own wizard emits `x402support`/`supportedTrusts` (verified by
  decoding neighbor agent #9661). The updated JSON carries BOTH x402
  casings deliberately.
- JSON changes (user-reviewed diff, approved): `active:true`,
  `x402support:true` + `x402Support:true`, `registrations[]` self-entry
  `eip155:42220:<registry>`, new `services[]` entry `{name:"wallet",
  endpoint:"eip155:42220:0xd16f…7D7E"}` (spec puts wallets in services or
  the on-chain `agentWallet` metadata key — the latter skipped for now),
  `supportedTrusts` renamed to spec `supportedTrust` (empty either way).
- Update tx (sent by user from the owner wallet):
  `0xc62d7cae268c67ac4041108478befe1749a7903fc9bb342edfc19a4f601d0230`
  — status success, block 71801569. Verified after: `tokenURI(9660)`
  decodes with all flags true; 8004scan's indexer re-indexed within
  minutes (`x402_supported: true`, list API
  `api.8004scan.io/api/v1/agents?chain=celo&search=bianca`). The list API
  has no `active` field — the profile badge renders from the JSON (now
  true); visually confirm at 8004scan.io/agents/celo/9660 (JS-rendered).

Also running: session-local hourly signal watch (cron at :07, dry-run
only, push-notifies on a tradeable signal ≥0.25 confidence — real sends
still require per-tx approval in chat).

Remaining for Phase 5: first ORGANIC signal-driven mainnet swap; Celo
Builders submission.

assigned tag — our self-chosen `bianca_markets` is NOT counted on its own.**
ERC-8021 suffixes carry multiple codes: after registration the swap engine
must emit `toDataSuffix(['bianca_markets', '<assignedTag>'])`. Counting
window is Jul 1–20 — every untagged day is uncounted volume, so register
EARLY. x402 settlements are facilitator-submitted (payer can't suffix them);
tracking there appears wallet-based via the `agentWalletAddress` submission
field (0xd16f…7D7E).

Submission fields (live API): `telegram` (registration-stage, required),
`socialLink` (X post URL, required), `erc8004Url`
(https://8004scan.io/agents/celo/9660), `agentWalletAddress`,
`celoNetwork` = `celo-mainnet` (only option), `appDomain` (optional),
aigora fields (optional, Track 4 only). Publish flow: connect via Google
sign-in + claim code → PUT /submissions/me (draft) → POST publish after
explicit approval.

Pre-registration blockers: public GitHub repo (repo has ZERO commits —
initial commit + push needed; repo slug determines the tag, choose once).

## Standing rules

- Never ask for the private key in chat — local `.env` only (gitignored).
- Ask before any real on-chain transaction or wallet-touching install.
- `DRY_RUN=true` default; mainnet token addresses must be verified on
  celoscan.io before real swaps (Phase 4 gate).
